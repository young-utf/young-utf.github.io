Africa TV with youtube 

In South Korea, there was a thing that I literally cannot understand 

which is people pay for the Africa TV service.

In that service, people pay a lot of money for the host of show, who is

just general people, not that special and even just eating without a word.

I just tried to understand their intents then I realized what is going on.

They are just bored with being alone and tried to communicate with others.

At that moment I decided to create a service targeting that kind of people in youtube.

In my case, I always use youtube so I think it would be enjoyable if I can real-time-chat with

people watching youtube in a same moment.

Thanks.
